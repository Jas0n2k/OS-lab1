Have you met all the specifications outlined for the lab?

In which order?
We started which are run directly with execvp such as ls and date. We then implemented the in built-in functions such as cd and exit. We then split up the I/O redirection, background processes and pipes.

What challenges did you encounter in meeting each specification?
The main difficulty when implementing pipes was to understand how pipes work and how the parser had placed the commands. It was really helpful to have the print_pgm(Pgm \*p) function to study as the recursive structure was kept when doing the pipes. It was also a small challenge to understand the desired behavior of pipes since we had limited experience using them.

Do you have any feedback for improving the lab materials?

Did you find the automated tests useful?
Yes they were useful to understand what you expect from the assignment and to know if you are going in the right direction.

Do you feel that there is any test case missing?
